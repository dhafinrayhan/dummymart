# DummyMart

An example Flutter project that uses [Riverpod], [go_router], [Hive], [flutter_hooks], and [Freezed].

## âš  Important Notes
This project uses [DummyJSON] API. Please note that DummyJSON **doesn't apply your changes** when creating, updating, or deleting items. This project correctly implements those actions, but expect no data changes due to these API limitations.

You can run the app with `--dart-define=MOCK_API=true` flag to use the internal mocked API that mimics the original API behavior and does modify your changes in a session. If you're using VSCode, you can instead run the app with the "dummymart (mock API)" configuration. Current limitations: any username/password is allowed to login and you will get a dummy profile data.

## Features
Each feature demonstrates certain functionalities that are commonly used in a CRUD app.
1. [Products](https://github.com/dhafinrayhan/dummymart/tree/master/lib/features/products): Basic **"view all items"** and **"view item details"** functionalities. Also implements **"pull-to-refresh"** mechanism.
2. [Todos](https://github.com/dhafinrayhan/dummymart/tree/master/lib/features/todos): Full CRUD operations, including **"add item"**, **"edit item"**, and **"delete item"**.
3. [Posts](https://github.com/dhafinrayhan/dummymart/tree/master/lib/features/posts): More advanced read operations such as **"search as we type (with debounce)"** and **"infinite scrolling"**.
4. [Auth](https://github.com/dhafinrayhan/dummymart/tree/master/lib/features/auth): Managing auth states, allowing functionalities such as **"invalidate all data when logging out"** and **"redirect screens based on the auth state"**.
